## Call Java and Scala code from Scala Native using JNI

Read my [blog post for more details](https://blog.indoorvivants.com/2025-02-08-java-from-scala-native-via-jni)

1. Make sure you have an env variable JAVA_HOME set to an existing java installation (on MacOS you can run `/usr/libexec/java_home` to see the location)
2. Make sure you have [Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) installed
3. Run `make run`
